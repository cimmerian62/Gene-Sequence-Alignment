# Gene-Sequence-Alignment
This program finds the optimal alignment of two sequences of genes represented by a two strings of letters A,G,C, or T.

The optimal alignment is based on the principle that a mismatch between two genes will add a cost of 1 to the final alignment, 
and a inserting a gap '_' in one of the sequences will add a cost of two to the final alignment. The Alignment with the lowest cost
is the optimal Alignment.
